- renv is not defined
- you don't call your data at the top of your app script
- All the data manipulation should be stored into one data-manipulation.R script
  > In this one, you make your data manipulation process
  > You save the ouput as a final_data.csv and it's this dataset you call in the app script
- you are creating some sub dataset (eg. product_perfomance, regional_sales,..) in the the data manipulation
process but then you don't use them in the app. And you also redefine them in the server in each sub plot server.
You don't need to do the operation twice. Better to save each sub-dataset as an output.csv in the data folder and
then call them in the app script using rio::import()

- Try to make one or two plots works correctly first instead of trying to implement all the plots/leaflet/ect.
